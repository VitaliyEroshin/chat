# Chat
## Requirements
**Tested on**
- MacOS (12.0.1)
- Ubuntu (20.04.3 LTS)

*Some other unix systems might work, but no promises.*
*Windows is not currently supported*

## Quick start
1) If you are running cmake 3.12+ you can build executables as simply as 
```
 ./build.sh
```

However, if you are running older version of cmake, there is another way to do the same thing:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2) Once executables have successfully been built, you can find your **server** and **client** executables in the ```./bin/``` folder.
3) Firstly, run the **server**.
```
./bin/server
```
 By default, it binds port ***8888***. If there are no errors, output must look like this:

4) Secondly, run the **client**.

5) To view available commands, type ```/help``` command in chat.
6) ***Have fun!*** ðŸ¥³
